<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Physics, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University, and a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR).

<div style="text-align: justify;">
My research focuses on establishing Sorcin as a model system for investigating protein aggregation. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations serve as the principal techniques in my research. Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming and hiking.
