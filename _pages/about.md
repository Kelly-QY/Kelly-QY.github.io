<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Physics, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University, and a visiting Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Maryland (UMD) and the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR).

My research focuses on establishing Sorcin as a model system for investigating protein aggregation. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations serve as the principal techniques in my research. Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming and hiking.
