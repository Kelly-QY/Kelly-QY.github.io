<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Physics, Xi’an Jiaotong University. My research focuses on establishing Sorcin as a model system for investigating protein aggregation. Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations serve as the principal techniques in my research. Outside the lab, I enjoy swimming and hiking.
